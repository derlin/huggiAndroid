<h1>Hugginess</h1>

<div style="text-align: center; font-style:italic;">"Encouraging Interpersonal Touch through Smart Clothes"</div>

<h2>Context</h2>

<p>
    This application is the result of a semester project at the <a href="https://www.eia-fr.ch/">University
    of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerland Fribourg.</a> Based on the <i>Hugginess</i> original idea, the
    student had to implement a first prototype, including a t-shirt and an application.
</p>

<h2>Concept Overview</h2>

<p>Physical contact has an important role in human well-being. <br/>
    Hugginess is a concept of interactive wearable system that encourages people to hug by augmenting this gesture with
    digital information exchange.</p>

<p>The system is based upon a smart t-shirt that recognizes hug and transmits digital information through conductive
    fabric while hugging. Thoes <i>HuggiShirt</i> can work standalone. Nevertheless, important and useful applications
    arise when they are paired to a smartphone or a PC. <br/>
    Indeed, applications could monitor the user's daily interpersonal touch interactions, detect their lack and take
    proactive measure. For example, we could imagine an application location aware which would automatically send an SMS
    to a nearby friend.
